								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>My name is Emily Weyda. I am an undergraduate senior graduating from the University of Cincinnati<br />
								in May 2020 with a major in computer engineering and a minor in computer science. I have completed co-ops<br />
								at Honeywell Intelligrated, ICR and Siemens Software. During these co-op semesters I have prioritized<br />
								gaining a broad variety of software experience, as well as obtaining lots of exposure to new technologies.<br />
								Outside of school, I like cooking, traveling, practicing yoga and wood carving.

								<h2>Honeywell Intelligrated</h2>
								<h5>August 2016 - December 2016</h5>
								<p>My first semester at Intelligrated was my first real exposure to a professional software environment, as well as my first time working  with many new software tools. I was able to gain experience with C#/.NET, SQL, XML and Winforms Applications, as well as learn how to use unit testing in a test driven development environment and command line processing. </p>
								<h5>May 2017 - August 2017</h5>
								<p>My second semester at Intelligrated I was put on an Agile scrum team collaborating with a small group working on an internal development tool. Using the skills I acquired in the first semester, I was able to effectively contribute to the team. Througout my semester I gained lots of R&D software development experience, and we were able to release the tool before I returned to school. </p>
								<h4>Skills Aquired</h5>
								<p>
								- One non-technical skill I gained at Intelligrated was how to adapt to working in a professional environment. Working is very different from school, and this being my first co-op, there was a lot to learn. This will be useful to me because I will need to use it for the rest of my professional life. <br />
								- One technical skill I gained at Intelligrated was Object Oriented Programming. Before I worked at Intelligrated, the only experience I had with coding was my first year in college. Being able to work with it on real projects and use it daily really helped me get a grasp on how to use OOP. This is important to me professionally because the software careers I am seeking will require me to use OOP in my work.

								<h2>ICR</h2>
								<h5>January 2018 - May 2018</h5>
								<p>At ICR I worked on a few small projects to add capability to GitLab continuous integration and development before embarking on my journey to become a cyber security reverse engineer. A lot of my work at ICR involved teaching myself ARM assembly language and how to reverse ARM binaries. </p>
								<h4>Skills Aquired</h5>
								<p>
								- One non-technical skill I gained at ICR was working as an individual on a project. ICR was small and the work I was given was a lot of individual work. I had to learn how to start and document projects without any external help. This is important to me professionally because I feel that I am better equipped to work on projects by myself.  <br />
								- One technical skill I gained at ICR was learning how to reverse ARM binaries. This will be useful to me professionally if I choose to pursue a career in cyber software engineering.

								<h2>Siemens Digital Industries Software</h2>
								<h5>January 2019 - August 2019</h5>
								<p>At Siemens I was given many opportunities to work on a wide range of projects. I was able to implement and validate machine learning techniques into Siemens ML software, as well as work with Google Cloud AutoML which was used to automate ML tasks and train deep learning frameworks. I also contributed to the development of a conversational interface for Siemens 3D modeling software, and at the end of the term, wrote a white paper on quantum computing. </p>
								<h4>Skills Aquired</h5>
								<p>
								- One non-technical skill I gained at Siemens was decision making. Because of the freedom I had in my projects and the large amount of tasks I was working on at any given time, I needed to be able to make decsions that would allow me to meet all of my deadlines and effectively and efficiently finish my work. This is important to me professionally because as a software engineer, I will definitely need good decision making skills to be able to handle all of my responsibilities and tasks. <br />
								- One technical skill I gained at Siemens was effective researching. I was given the opportunity to research many different things, and I was able to help the team decide if we would use specific technologies. This will prove useful in my professional career a lot because this skill is applicable to any situation when choosing a tech stack.

								<h2>Career Goal</h2>
								<p>After graduating from the University of Cincinnati, I would like to pursue a career in the software industry.</p>
								<h2>Summative Reflection</h2>
								<p>During the past five years at the University of Cincinnati I have grown tremendously as a professional and as an individual. I have completed five co-op rotations (Honeywell Intelligrated, ICR & Siemens Software), went on a study abroad to the United Kingdom and have continuously expanded my skill set to become a well rounded software engineer. One of the biggest reasons I chose UC was for the co-op program, and I feel that it has helped prepare me for the professional world in an impactful way. If I were starting over again, I would have taken more software focused classes closer to the beginning of my degree. My learning and growth in the co-op program was was fulfilling because it gave me many real world industry experience which has made me a more confident software engineer earlier in my career.</p>
