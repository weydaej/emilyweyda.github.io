            <p class="about-p">I am a senior <a class="regular-link hoverable" href="https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/electrical-engineering-computer-science/degrees-programs/computer-engineering-bachelor-of-science.html" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> student graduating from the University of Cincinnati in May 2020 with a minor in computer science. I have completed internships with <a class="regular-link hoverable" href="https://www.intelligrated.com/en" target="_blank">Honeywell Intelligrated</a>, <a class="regular-link hoverable" href="https://icr-team.com/" target="_blank">ICR</a> and <a class="regular-link hoverable" href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/industries/software-development/" target="_blank">Siemens Software</a>. During these, I prioritized gaining a broad variety of software experience, and obtained exposure to dozens of new technologies. Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, traveling, practicing yoga and wood carving.</p>

            <p>One non-technical skill I gained at Intelligrated was how to adapt to a professional work environment. This skill will be useful to me for the rest of my career as I transition from role-to-role.
            
            One technical skill I gained at Intelligrated was Object Oriented Programming. My prior experience with coding were first-year college courses. The ability to work on real projects and code daily helped me learn and use OOP. This is important since the software roles I am seeking will require me to use OOP.</p>

I was able to gain experience with C#/.NET, SQL, XML and Winforms Applications, as well as learn how to use unit testing in a test driven development environment and command line processing.</p>

            <p>One non-technical skill I gained at ICR was working as an individual on a project. ICR was small and the work I was given was a lot of individual work. I had to learn how to start and document projects without any external help. This is important to me professionally because I feel that I am better equipped to work on projects by myself.
                
            One technical skill I gained at ICR was learning how to reverse ARM binaries. This will be useful to me professionally if I choose to pursue a career in cyber software engineering.</p>

                <p>At ICR I worked on a few small projects to add capability to GitLab continuous integration and development before embarking on my journey to become a cyber security reverse engineer. A lot of my work at ICR involved teaching myself ARM assembly language and how to reverse ARM binaries.</p>

            <p>One non-technical skill I gained at Siemens was decision making. Because of the freedom I had in my projects and the large amount of tasks I was working on at any given time, I needed to be able to make decsions that would allow me to meet all of my deadlines and effectively and efficiently finish my work. This is important to me professionally because as a software engineer, I will definitely need good decision making skills to be able to handle all of my responsibilities and tasks.
                
            One technical skill I gained at Siemens was effective researching. I was given the opportunity to research many different things, and I was able to help the team decide if we would use specific technologies. This will prove useful in my professional career a lot because this skill is applicable to any situation when choosing a tech stack.</p>

                <p>At Siemens I was given many opportunities to work on a wide range of projects. I was able to implement and validate machine learning techniques into Siemens ML software, as well as work with Google Cloud AutoML which was used to automate ML tasks and train deep learning frameworks. I also contributed to the development of a conversational interface for Siemens 3D modeling software, and at the end of the term, wrote a white paper on quantum computing.</p>

            <hr class="hr-reflection"/>

            <p class="reflection-p">During the past five years at the University of Cincinnati I have grown tremendously as a professional and as an individual. I have completed five co-op rotations (Honeywell Intelligrated, ICR & Siemens Software), went on a study abroad to the United Kingdom and have continuously expanded my skill set to become a well rounded software engineer. One of the biggest reasons I chose UC was for the co-op program, and I feel that it has helped prepare me for the professional world in an impactful way. If I were starting over again, I would have taken more software focused classes closer to the beginning of my degree. My learning and growth in the co-op program was was fulfilling because it gave me many real world industry experience which has made me a more confident software engineer earlier in my career.</p>
